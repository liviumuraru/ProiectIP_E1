the most efficient way to query GitHub projects and repositories is the GitHub API:


- to extensively search projects by ID, name, keywords, ordering etc. , check out https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories
- to work with Projects, check out https://developer.github.com/v3/projects/#list-repository-projects
- to work with repositories, check out https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/

- to download data from a repository, there are multiple ways, each with it's own Pros/Cons:

1. URL-based:
 ex:  https://github.com/username/repository_name/archive/branch_name.zip downloads the contents of the latest commit on "branch_name"

PROS:
  simple
CONS:
  can't download specific files
  can only download latest commits

2. GitHub Repository Contents API:
  https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/

PROS:
  not as difficult to use as the Trees API
  can download specific files
CONS:
  this API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the Git Trees API.
  this API supports files up to 1 megabyte in size.

3. GitHub Trees API
  https://developer.github.com/v3/git/trees/

PROS:
  retrieves the full git commit tree, with branches
  powerful and extensive
  can build repo programatically

CONS:
  complex and difficult to use

NOTE: The GitHub Projects and GitHub repository APIs are in preview mode! Expect changes!
