## How To Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and integrators understand your report/request, reproduce the behavior, and find related requests/reports.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which code your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers and integrators reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem. (e.g. [BUG-Fatal/Major/Minor/Warning] Clicking on X will insert a W) 
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** if necessary which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

#### Local development

### Example of a contributor's workflow:
* fork the branch you want to start working on, and branch out of it if necessary
* commit your proposed changes; make commits as explicit as possible, with mandatory **Removed**, **Added**, **Bugfixes** and **Modified** commit description sections, if necessary
* create a pull request with the origin's tracked branch as `base` and your forked branch as `from` and give it a simple and explicit description!
